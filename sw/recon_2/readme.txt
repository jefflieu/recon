To download program to flash memory: 
- use nios2-flash-program software and the fpga has to be alive with a NIOS+Flash memory controller. What the nios2-flash-program does is that it overtakes the NIOS
and access the flash itself.
- The default Makefile generated by Altera in the <APP> folder always puts the .elf image at address 0x0 which is wrong, because the fpga image is there.
Therefore, if you run make program-flash from the <APP> folder you have to add <flash_mem_epcs_flag=--epcs --after=../fpga.flash>
